# Time Details and Changelist
- Added mouse control (Time: Like an hour, but now I know what I'm doing, probably.)
  - Made velocity non-linear (Time: Fifteen minutes)
- Added a timer bar (Time: I got distracted. This actually took like twenty minutes.)
- Particle effects! (Time: This took like two hours because it kept breaking.)
- Reset game after dying/finishing (Time: Thirty minutes)
- Sound effects (Time: Another hour. Albeit, most of that was trying to find a good way to get isolated piano notes.)
